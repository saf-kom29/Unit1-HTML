    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p> Hello there-and welcome to my homework page! My name is <b>Safiyya Leyli Komurova</b>, and I am attending Bergen Technical Schools! I am in <i>9th</i> grade, which means I am a freshman in this high school. Even if I'm not sharing much of my personal information on this site, I'm excited to share more about me later on in this project! Hopefully, you'll see me as a fun person! First of all, fun fact about me: I may not seem like it, but I've been trying to learn <u><i>Turkish</i></u> since <em>seventh grade</em>!</p>

    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <h3>Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <p>One hobby I've had, one that goes <em>beyond</em> the test of time, is the one <strong>beautiful</strong> art of <u><strong>DRAWING.</strong></u> There's nothing like it; utilizing a mere <i>pencil and paper</i> to create a 2D <em>masterpiece</em>. It's also a reflection of the <u>self.</u> Whatever you choose to create really symbolizes how you think, how you choose to portray yourself--<strong>anything you imagine is your creation.</strong>I started drawing as a hobby in <u>5th grade</u>, and I'm happy to say that I'm not stopping any time soon!</p>
    <h3>Other Things I Like</h3>
    <p>There's also a few other things I like: <br> <i>Writing,</i>which is a way to express yourself in the form of writing a few characters, a plot, and seeing how to make the two interact-- a truly <em> wonderful</em> experience. I've also been playing the piano for <b>nine years!</b> So, naturally, I feel that I have a knack for it. On top of playing the piano, it also gives me a sense of <u>calm</u> while performing, like I'm releasing all of my worries through the <i>flow of the music.</i></p>
